Plugin graphic options
======================

For advance usage of plugins in different context would be useful to implement a template 
system that allow to modify the rendering of the plugin depends of context and with different templates.
This approach is very useful in future if you need to render different templates of the same plugin.

This approach extend the CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS to allow more dinamic customization.

plugin_basetemplate can be set in the context so it's possible to change base template on the fly.

Real world case are implementing a Text with a border and without a border.
